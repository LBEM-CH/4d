# This file represents the data processing database.
# All processing parameters for individual images are stored in copies of this file. The copies are then called 2dx_image.cfg.
# The merging directory also uses a copy of this file, which is then called 2dx_merge.cfg.
# Upon launching, the program does the following:
# It reads the system-wide root version of this file, which could for example reside in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the personal choice, usually stored in ~/.2dx/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the project wide database, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/merge/2dx_merge.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the tilt-angle specific databases, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the image-specific values, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/ProtA0012345601/2dx_image.cfg,
# .... but it ONLY does the latter update, if the parameter "SYNC_WITH_UPPER_LEVEL" is not set to "YES".
# This results in the loaded database that 4d keeps in RAM memory, until you press the SAVE icon on that program.
#
# If you want to process one additional image, it will be initialized with a copy of the 2dx_master.cfg file one level above. You can there define your default starting values for the parameters for these images, e.g. define kV, Cs, defocus, pixel size, etc.. once for the entire processing batch.
#
# If you want to update the database by adding one additional parameter, you should do that on the system-wide file in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg. Upon opening 4d and saving the database, you then have added that parameter to your local working file.

For a CCD camera, this value is typically 10 to 25 micrometer. For a TEM, the CCD camera can produce images of a different magnification than the screen, due to a so-called post-magnification between screen and CCD. You have to either give the exact CCD camera pixel size, and then specify as "magnification" the real magnification between sample and CCD, including any "post-magnification", or you have to give as "CCD pixel size" a value that takes the post-magnification into account. In this case, give as CCD pixel size the size that would correspond to a CCD pixel on the screen. In micrometer.

# LABEL: Resolution of the merged dataset for reference
# LEGEND: Specifies the resolution up to which the merged dataset can/should be used as reference for unbending of the images. The other parameter "RESMAX - Upper Resolution Limit" is used to define the resolution limit up to which the processing of one image, or up to which the merging of all available data should be done. This parameter here "MergeResolution - Resolution of the merged dataset" instead defines, to which resolution the final merged dataset should be limited, to be used as reference. You could for example process data up to 7A resolution, but provide a reference that only contains data up to 10A resolution, so that more noisy data in the 10-7A range are not used to wrongly influence the re-processing of your images.
