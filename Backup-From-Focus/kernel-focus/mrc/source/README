These are the source code files for the programs that are used in the image 
processing of the 2D crystal images. 

These files are based on a subset of the MRC programs, which were written by 
Richard Henderson and others. We have modified or extended some MRC programs 
in order to interface them with the 2dx software environment, and have added 
some additional functions and programs.

The original MRC programs continue to evolve, and the users are encouraged to 
contact Jude Short (JMS@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk) or Richard Henderson 
(rh15@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk) for the complete set and a more recent version of 
their programs.
