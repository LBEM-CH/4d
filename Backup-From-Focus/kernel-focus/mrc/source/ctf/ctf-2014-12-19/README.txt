=================

An additional parameter, dAst, was added to CARD 4 to restrain the amount of astigmatism in the CTF fit. This makes the fitting procedure more robust, especially in cases where the Thon rings are not easily visible.

=============

ctffind3 (version 3.4 and higher) and ctftilt (version 1.5 and higher) can now make use of openMP. Use the _mp makefiles to compile, for example

make -f Makefile_linux_mp

This will produce executables

ctffind3_mp.exe
ctftilt_mp.exe

To use more than one processor, you will need to set the environmental variable NCPUS. For example, when using the tcsh shell:

setenv NCPUS 8

to use 8 processors. With 8 processors, ctffind3 runs about 6 times faster and ctftilt about 4 times faster.

C       CTFFIND3 - determines defocus and astigmatism for images of

C       x axis (same convetiones as in the MRC 2D image processing
C       programs).
