This directory contains a copy of the CTFFIND3 and CTFTILT software that is developed by Niko Grigorieff.

This was downloaded on September 1, 2007, from

and is included here with the kind permission from Niko Grigorieff.

For this distribution, the files ctffind3 and ctftilt were renamed into 2dx_ctffind3 and 2dx_ctftilt, to distinguish from possibly existing original versions of these programs on your harddrive. We have slightly modified the original programs to interface them with the 2dx GUI. Specifically, the modifications concern the output of the determined values into a form that can easily be read by the 2dx GUI.

ctffind 3.1 and ctftilt 1.2

two programs for finding CTFs of electron micrographs (96 kb). The program CTFFIND3 is an updated version of the program CTFFIND2 which was developed in 1998 by Nikolaus Grigorieff at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK with financial support from the MRC.
A paper describing these programs is: 
Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.
