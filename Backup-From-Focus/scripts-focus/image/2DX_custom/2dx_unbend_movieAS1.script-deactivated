# MANUAL: Movie mode unbending script
#
# MANUAL: Prerequisite I: Installed eman2/sparx package. Ensure that the eman2.bashrc is sourced (optimally in your bash.rc or .profile file) before starting 2dx. 
#
# MANUAL: Prerequisite II: Python-2.7 (or higher) including matplotlib and numpy. If you have installed eman2, this should be available on your system.
#
# MANUAL: Prerequisite III: PDFtk. You can get it from "https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/".   Or, try on OSX:  port install pdftk
#
# MANUAL: Prerequisite IV: ps2pdf (Linux) or pstopdf (OSX). These should be already present.
#
# MANUAL: Prerequisite IV: pdf2ps. This is part of ghostscript. You can get it with:  port install <B>ghostscript</b>.
#
# MANUAL: Before using movie-mode unbending, switch movie-mode processing on and rerun "InitFilesAndParams" to preset the used batch size dependening on the number of available movie-frames.
#
# MANUAL: Using the movie-mode unbent APH-file requires selecting the movie-mode option in "Correct CTF" and rerunning of "Generate Map".
#
# MANUAL: Careful prevention of overfitting is crucial for successful movie-mode 3D reconstructions.
