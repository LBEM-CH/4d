This folder contains many programs and Python scripts that you may want to have available as standalone tools or modules.
In order to do this, please add the directory ${4D_ROOT}/scripts/proc/ to your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables.
For example by adding the following lines to your .bashrc file:

export 4D_ROOT=/path/to/focus/installation/
export PATH=${4D_ROOT}/scripts/proc/
export PYTHONPATH=${4D_ROOT}/scripts/proc/
